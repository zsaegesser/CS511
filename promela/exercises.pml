/*

two processes server 1 and server 2. Server 1 is blocked on request = 1,
and server 2 is blocked on request = 2.
Client sends request =1 (send message), then it will set request = 0,
and then progress to set request = 2.

If we grab this program and we try to verify it, it will get those invalid
endstates. If we verify this, we get errors:1, invalid endstate.

It becomes deadlocked at line 5 of requtest = 1, and line 12 of request == 2.


Servers are meant to run without stopping.
To indicate to spin, use "endserver: " label

Spin now knows that if it's blocked, it's ok because it's expected from the
point of view of the model.
